These are the attempts from @alext and @timblair for the exercises from this
workshop.  Note: these are very much not "solutions."

You can run all tests by doing the following (ignore the `no buildable Go
source files` warning during `go get`):

```
go get github.com/alext/talks/gds-go/01/examples
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/alext/talks/gds-go/01/exercises
go test -v ./...
```
